# Schemas

The collection of schemas used in custom projets, including the `theme-config.json` schemas.

JSON schemas are used by code editors to offer tooltips, autocomplete, and validation.

## JSON schema usage

Many editors recognize the `$schema` property in JSON files.

Update your `theme-config.json` to include:

```json
{
	"$schema": ""
}
```
